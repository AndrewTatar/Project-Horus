Instructions, general info HERE! I find i have to stop the process 
in the Task Manager after lanching this, using ALT-TAB is not 
working on this release version for me (works in debgug mode lauched frm VS Studio though).
Next task is to add an input field for email address and attempt to add
a function script function that sends the email with a the .apk attched to the
supplied email address. This might be too ambitious however it is theoretically
possible. The setup file created by Script.iss is in the ooutput folder in the HorusSetup Project. 
This file is the project Horus deliverable.
